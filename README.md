# Cabinet Instrumentation

This repository is designed to facilitate the development of a termite monitoring system that utilises temperature, humidity and acceleration/vibration sensors to collect real-time data on termite actions and movements, allowing for in-depth behavioural and mobility analysis. The repository is written in Embedded C language and implemented using STM32 microcontroller, providing a robust foundation for data acquisition and analysis.
